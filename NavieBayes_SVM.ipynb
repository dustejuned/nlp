The main reason is that\\ngood hitters in their prime (such as Frank Thomas and Danny Tartabull)\\nare rarely regular DH\\'s, even if they can\\'t field; it\\'s more commonly a\\nplace to put aging veterans.\\n\\nAnother use of the DH slot is to help a player come back from injury\\nslowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the\\nfield.  I would expect such players to hit worse as DH\\'s than they did\\nduring the rest of the season.\\n\\nA third factor is that most player who split time between DH and first\\nor the outfield don\\'t hit as well as DH\\'s for some reason.  Reggie\\nJackson was a good example; in five years as a RF/DH for the Angels, he\\nhit like the old Reggie when he was in right.\\n\\nThe second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by\\ntheir primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60\\nat DH will count only in the right fielders\\' averages.\\n\\n> \\tA logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement\\n> value (if you can find it) for 1B or LF or something.

This\\n> would let us \"discount\" the time they spend playing DH, because that\\n> forces the team to find another real fielder to play.\\n\\nThis makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  Although the\\n*average* offensive performance of a DH may be lower than for a left\\nfielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly\\nlower; if you are a left fielder but can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job\\nanywhere, then you certainly can\\'t hit well enough to keep a job at DH.\\n\\n\\n--\\nDavid Grabiner, grabiner@zariski.harvard.edu\\n\"We are sorry, but the number you have dialed is imaginary.\"\\n\"Please rotate your phone 90 degrees and try again.\"\\nDisclaimer: I speak for no one and no one speaks for me.\\n',\n",

But there is a way with  \\nan additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  \\nsame high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  \\nthen. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  \\nYou need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  \\nYour original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)  \\nidea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don\\'t  \\nknow of an address anymore).\\n\\nCheers    Robert   (HB9NBY) \\n--\\nRobert Ganter\\t\\t\\t/------------\\\\\\nUniversitaet Basel\\t\\t| I am a fan |\\nInstitut fuer Informatik\\t| of my plan |\\nBasel/Switzerland\\t\\t\\\\------------/\\nganter@ifi.unibas.ch\\namateurradio: HB9NBY\\tpacket: HB9NBY@HB9EAS.CHE.EU\\n',\n",
